The Approov dynamic module for NGINX Plus will show how simple is to integrate the [Approov Token](https://www.approov.io/docs/latest/approov-usage-documentation/#approov-tokens) check to protect the access to an API backend, without requiring any changes to its code, by leveraging the NGINX Plus support for dynamic modules in order to include the Approov Token check functionality, that only requires minimal changes to the actual NGINX Plus configuration.
